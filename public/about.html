<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Computing Science student at the University of Alberta with a strong interest in programming, problem-solving, and creating efficient solutions. My primary skills are in Python and C, where I focus on writing clean, understandable, and well-structured code</p>

<p>I am the first in my family to pursue a bachelorâ€™s degree, coming from a village where higher education is rare and often undervalued. While the journey has been challenging, I take pride in the opportunity to study and am committed to pushing forward despite obstacles. This background has shaped my resilience, work ethic, and determination to make the most of every learning experience.</p>

<p>I enjoy learning new technologies, applying logical thinking to tackle challenges, and continuously improving my technical abilities. Beyond coursework, I am passionate about sharing knowledge and helping others, having volunteered as a tutor to support learners in building confidence in their skills. I am eager to contribute to projects where I can apply my programming knowledge, learn from real-world applications, and grow as a developer..</p>
